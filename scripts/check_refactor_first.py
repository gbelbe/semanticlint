"""Refactor First gate — see CRAFTSMANSHIP.md's "Refactor First" section for
the workflow this enforces the outcome of, not the procedure.

Fails when a touched `.py` file's total across the 8 mechanically-detectable
heuristics (craftcov.py --list-detectors) did not go down relative to where
this branch diverged from its base — unless it was already at 0, in which
case it must simply stay at 0 (a clean file can't be made dirtier and still
pass). Total-based, not per-heuristic: fixing one instance of every present
heuristic type (the workflow this gate checks the outcome of) always drops
the total by exactly the number of heuristic types that were present, so a
strict total decrease is exactly what that workflow produces.

Bypassed by a `Tidy-Exempt:` trailer anywhere in the commit range — the same
escape hatch check_tidy_ratchet.sh already uses. One exemption mechanism,
not two.

Needs its own full-corpus scan of the merge-base tree via a throwaway `git
worktree` (dupes is corpus-wide — a duplicate only means anything relative
to its other copy, so there's no way to get an accurate "before" count for
one file without scanning every file at that revision too), plus a scan of
the current tree. Both calls bypass craftcov.py's on-disk cache entirely
(this script calls its scan functions directly) since a merge-base worktree
is thrown away right after and a repeat run should never see stale numbers.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_refactor_first.py --base <ref> [--head <ref>]

Examples:
    python3 scripts/check_refactor_first.py --base origin/main
    python3 scripts/check_refactor_first.py --base origin/main --head HEAD
