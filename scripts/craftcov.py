"""craftCov — a coverage-report-style scan of the craftsmanship catalog.

Honest about its limits before anything else: only the entries in
catalog.yaml that carry `detectors` (8 of 31 as of this writing — see
`--list-detectors`) have a real mechanical proxy. Three engines reused, one
technique ported rather than reimplemented from scratch:

  - `ruff` (Rust, already a dependency in every repo this ships to, ships
    its own fast internal cache) — guard-clauses, dead-code,
    explaining-constant, extract-helper, introduce-parameter-object,
    replace-conditional-with-polymorphism.
  - `pylint`, scoped to exactly two rules (R0902/R0904) — extract-class /
    God Class. ruff hasn't ported these yet (R0904 is preview-only there,
    R0902 doesn't exist in ruff at all); upstream pylint's originals are
    stable, so this is the one entry that needs a second tool on PATH.
  - `vulture` — a second, higher-recall pass for dead-code alongside
    ruff's F401/F811/F841: catches unused module-level functions/classes
    ruff's own-file-scoped checks can't see. Verified on a real, framework-
    heavy codebase (kai-ster: pytest-bdd + Textual) while building this:
    vulture's confidence scores cluster hard into two tiers — unused
    *variables* at 100% (redundant with ruff's own F841, adds nothing) and
    unused functions/classes/methods at 60% (vulture's own "fairly sure but
    could be wrong" floor — decorator-registered step defs and Textual's
    on_* handlers score exactly here without being genuinely dead). That
    60% tier is also where all of vulture's actual unique value lives, so
    craftCov reports it unfiltered by default (`--vulture-min-confidence 0`,
    vulture's own default) rather than quietly discarding the one thing
    ruff can't already tell you — raise the threshold yourself via
    `--vulture-min-confidence` once you've triaged a first pass and know
    your codebase's noise floor. The per-finding confidence is preserved in
    `--verbose`/JSON output for exactly this triage.
  - `dupes` (this module's own code, not a subprocess) — a from-scratch
    port of the rolling-hash line-window matching technique both PMD CPD
    (Karp-Rabin string matching over a token stream, per PMD's own docs)
    and pylint's own R0801 checker (same technique, one level coarser:
    stripped lines instead of language tokens — verified against pylint's
    actual source before porting) use — consolidate-duplicate-conditional.
    Ported rather than subprocessing pylint's checker because its CLI only
    puts ONE of a duplicate pair's two locations in structured JSON output
    (the other is free text inside the message), and its internal API is
    private/unstable across versions. See that section of this file for
    the full explanation, including why it's corpus-wide (runs over every
    file, every time — never through the per-file cache, unlike the three
    subprocess engines above) and what "exact match, no docstring
    special-casing" means for it in practice.

Feature Envy, Data Clumps *precisely* (not just "too many params" — the
*same group* repeating), Message Chains, Primitive Obsession, Refused
Bequest, and every `principle`/`workflow` entry have no detector on
purpose: no maintained, reusable Python tool exists for any of them
(checked against the design-smell-detection literature, which is
Java/C#/C++-tooling-only). A regex or AST check confident enough to report
these would cry wolf more than it'd help. Those stay a job for the
procedure in CRAFTSMANSHIP.md (read the code, ask the developer), not this
script. craftCov finds the mechanically-checkable subset; it is not a
replacement for the judgment call the rest of the catalog asks for.

Caching: findings for a file are cached by its content hash, keyed by path
relative to the scan root (so the cache survives the repo moving to a
different absolute path). A re-run only re-scans files whose hash changed
since the last run (or that are new); everything else is read back from
`.craftcov_cache.json`. This is on top of, not instead of, each tool's own
cache where it has one (ruff's `.ruff_cache/`) — craftCov's cache also
stores the class/function attribution none of the three tools track on
their own, so a warm re-run skips re-parsing ASTs too, not just re-linting.

When more than one tool flags the *same* line for the *same* heuristic
(e.g. ruff's F401 and vulture both catch an unused import), it's counted
once, not twice — see `scan_files`'s dedup.

Requires (unlike the other craft-gate scripts, which are plain bash):
PyYAML importable, plus whichever of `ruff` / `pylint` / `vulture` is on
PATH for the detectors catalog.yaml actually uses — only invoked if at
least one entry needs it, so a repo without pylint installed still gets
the other engines' findings, not a hard failure. `dupes` needs nothing
beyond the stdlib. `uv sync --extra craftcov` in this repo installs all
three external engines; see README's Requirements.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/craftcov.py                  # scan, text report
    python3 scripts/craftcov.py --format json     # machine-readable
    python3 scripts/craftcov.py --verbose         # + every finding, file:line
    python3 scripts/craftcov.py --no-cache        # ignore and overwrite the cache
    python3 scripts/craftcov.py --list-detectors  # which heuristics are detectable, and how
