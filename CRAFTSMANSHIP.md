# Craftsmanship catalog

This is the source of truth for everything except the two catalog tables
below, which are generated from `catalog.yaml` — edit that file, not the
tables here directly (see the repo's CONTRIBUTING.md, "Adding a heuristic
or rule").
This file does not assume any particular AI tool or editor — a human
contributor, a CI script, or an agent can all read it directly. Tool-specific
wrappers (a Claude Code skill, a pre-commit hook, a CI job) point back here
rather than re-stating it.

Two separate concerns, on purpose:

1. **Writing new code well the first time** — a checklist, not a commit
   ritual. Nothing to "tidy" in code that doesn't exist yet.
2. **Changing existing code safely** — Kent Beck's *Tidy First?* discipline:
   every commit is either structural (doesn't change behavior) or behavioral
   (changes what the code does), never both. When existing code is untested
   ("legacy," per Feathers' definition below), tidying needs a safety net
   first.

Every entry below is attributed. When you act on one — proposing it to the
developer, or citing it in a commit — **name the smell and its source**, the
same way you'd cite a source in any other claim. "This function does two
unrelated things (Feature Envy, Fowler)" is a specific, checkable claim.
"This could be cleaner" is not.

## Procedure

### Before writing a feature or fix on existing code

1. Read the file(s)/function(s)/class(es) the change is about to touch.
2. Check them against the catalog below. For each smell that applies, work
   out what it's actually worth here: the smell you found, its source, the
   tidying/refactoring that addresses it, and the concrete value it brings to
   the change that follows.
3. **Ask the developer to confirm before touching anything — don't decide
   silently.** Which tidying (if any) is worth doing is a judgment call the
   automation can't make:
   - One candidate: state the smell (with its source), the fix, and the
     value it brings; ask for a go/no-go.
   - Several candidates: present them as options, each with its own value
     explanation and source; ask which to do — "none of these" is valid.
4. Once confirmed, make *only* that change, confirm existing tests are
   unchanged, and commit it alone (see **Commit convention** below).
5. Only then commit the feature/fix itself, as its own commit.
6. If nothing applies, or the developer declines every option, don't invent
   one — commit the feature with a `Tidy-Exempt:` trailer instead (see
   below).
7. Never mix a tidying commit with a behavior change in the same diff.

### Before writing new code

Run it past the **new-code checklist** below *before* declaring it done —
this is a design pass, not a commit type. There's no ratchet for it because
"is this well-designed" isn't mechanically checkable the way a diff is; it's
on the author and the reviewer.

### Before refactoring code with no tests (legacy code)

See **Working with legacy code** below — write a characterization test
first, then tidy under its safety net.

## The catalog

### Structural tidyings — Kent Beck, *Tidy First?* (2023)

Small, purely structural moves: they don't change behavior, so a tidying
commit's test results must be identical before and after.

### Smells and their fixes — Fowler (with Beck), *Refactoring*, 2nd ed. (2018)

Broader than Tidy First's structural-only scope — these describe design
problems and their standard fixes. They apply to existing code you're about
to touch *and* are worth watching for while writing new code.

<!-- END GENERATED: smell-fix -->

*Comments as a smell* (Fowler, and independently Martin below): a comment
explaining *what* a block does is a signal the block wants a name, not a
comment — that's `extract-helper`/`explaining-variable`, not
`explaining-comment`. Reach for `explaining-comment` only for *why*, never
*what*.

*Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces*: usually the same situation
as `normalize-symmetries` one level up — two things that do the same job
should look like it.

### New-code principles — Robert C. Martin, *Clean Code* (2008)

Design checklist, not a commit ritual — apply while writing, not after.

- **A function does one thing, and stays small.** If you're reaching for
  "and" to describe what it does, it's two functions.
- **Prefer 0–2 arguments; 3 is a smell, more needs restructuring** — often
  `introduce-parameter-object` (above) is the fix, before the function is
  even written.
- **No flag arguments.** A boolean parameter that makes a function silently
  do one of two different things should be two functions.
- **Command-Query Separation.** A function either does something or answers
  something — never both. A function named `getX` that also mutates state
  will surprise every caller that doesn't read its body.
- **SOLID** (Martin, *Agile Software Development*, 2002) — most relevant day
  to day: **Dependency Inversion** (isolate an external library behind a
  thin internal adapter — the rest of the code depends on your interface,
  not the library) and **Single Responsibility** (one reason to change,
  which is exactly what `extract-class` fixes after the fact).

### The bar for new code — Kent Beck, *Extreme Programming Explained* (1999/2004)

Beck's four rules of simple design, **in priority order** — when they
conflict, an earlier rule wins:

1. Passes all the tests.
2. Reveals intention (a reader doesn't have to guess what it's for).
3. No duplication.
4. Fewest elements (no speculative generality — YAGNI, applied prospectively).

### A stricter optional reference — Sandi Metz's rules

Deliberately extreme, meant to provoke a conversation rather than be taken
literally: classes ≤100 lines, methods ≤5 lines, ≤4 parameters. Useful when
a project's own complexity ceiling feels too permissive and the team wants a
sharper target to aim for — not a gate.

## Working with legacy code — Michael Feathers, *Working Effectively with Legacy Code* (2004)

Feathers' definition: **legacy code is code without tests** — age is
irrelevant. Untested code can't be tidied safely the normal way, because
"confirm the existing tests are unchanged" (the whole point of a structural
commit) has nothing to confirm against.

The procedure, step by step:

1. **Find a seam** — a place you can observe or change behavior without
   editing the code at that exact spot (a constructor argument, a factory,
   an injected dependency).
2. **Write a characterization test** — a test that documents what the code
   *actually does right now*, including its bugs. It isn't asserting the
   code is correct, only that you've pinned its current behavior down before
   touching it. Commit it on its own:
   ```
   test(characterize): pin OrderValidator.validate's current null-handling

   Tidy-Source: Michael Feathers, Working Effectively with Legacy Code (2004)
   ```
3. **Now tidy or refactor under that safety net**, same procedure as above —
   the characterization test is what "confirm existing tests are unchanged"
   means for code that had no tests at all a moment ago.
4. Once real (intent-driven, not just characterizing) tests exist, the code
   graduates out of "legacy" — the characterization test can be extended or
   replaced by tests that assert *intended* behavior rather than merely
   *current* behavior.

A `test(characterize):` commit satisfies the tidy-ratchet the same way a
`tidy(<type>):` commit does (see **The ratchet**) — it's the prerequisite
move for legacy code, not an exemption from the discipline.

---

## Commit convention

```
tidy(extract-class): split OrderValidator's audit-log concern into its own class

Tidy-Type: extract-class
Tidy-Source: Martin Fowler (with Kent Beck), Refactoring, 2nd ed. (2018)
Tidy-Scope: OrderValidator
```

- **Subject**: `tidy(<id>): <what and where>`, `<id>` from the catalog's
  `id` column.
- **`Tidy-Type:`** — same id, machine-queryable.
- **`Tidy-Source:`** — the author/book the smell or tidying comes from. If
  it's a locally-invented tidying not in this catalog, say so plainly
  (`Tidy-Source: project convention, see docs/...`) rather than omit it —
  the point is traceability, not gatekeeping which sources count.
- **`Tidy-Scope:`** — the function/class/module touched.

If nothing applied and none was invented:

```
Tidy-Exempt: <one-line reason>
```

Legacy-code prerequisite work uses `test(characterize):` (see above) instead
of `tidy(...)`.

## The ratchet

A commit-message check (`scripts/check_tidy_ratchet.sh`) fails a push/PR
whose commit range has no `tidy(<type>):` commit, no `test(characterize):`
commit, and no `Tidy-Exempt:` trailer. Text-only, no test run — costs
milliseconds. It cannot judge whether the right tidying was picked, only
that the discipline (or an explicit, reviewable exemption) was followed.

## Refactor First — a mechanically-enforced instance of the procedure above

For any heuristic craftCov can detect (see DESIGN.md's craftCov section, or
`scripts/craftcov.py --list-detectors` — 8 of the 35 entries above as of
this writing), the "which tidying, ask the developer" judgment call in step
3 of the procedure becomes fully mechanical instead:

1. Before touching file `F`, scope craftCov to it:
   `uv run python3 scripts/craftcov.py --file <F>`.
2. For each detectable heuristic present (count > 0), fix exactly **one**
   instance — the catalog's `action` field says what to do. A heuristic at
   0 for this file needs nothing.
3. Bundle every fix into **one** commit, not one per heuristic:

   ```
   tidy(multi): order_validator.py — one fix per present heuristic (4 -> 0)

   Tidy-Scope: order_validator.py
   Tidy-Fix: CG012 extract-helper (Kent Beck, Tidy First? 2023) 3->2
   Tidy-Fix: CG002 dead-code (Kent Beck, Tidy First? 2023) 5->4
   Tidy-Fix: CG009 explaining-constant (Kent Beck, Tidy First? 2023) 2->1
   ```

   `Tidy-Fix:` — repeated, one line per heuristic fixed — replaces the
   single `Tidy-Type:`/`Tidy-Source:` pair for this bundled case: a
   heuristic id, its source, and its before→after count in one line.
   `Tidy-Scope:` stays as in the general convention above.
4. Only then commit the feature/fix itself, as usual.

**Bounded effort, not exhaustive.** This fixes one instance of every present
heuristic type per touch, not the whole file — a heavily-smelly legacy file
doesn't need to be perfect before a feature can land in it, just measurably
better. Counts trend to zero over repeated touches, the same incremental
spirit as the rest of this catalog.

**Enforced, not just documented.** `scripts/check_refactor_first.py` (wired
into CI as the `refactor-first` job, PR-only) fails a PR when a touched
`.py` file's *total* across the 8 detectable heuristics didn't go down
relative to where the branch diverged from its base — or, if the file was
already at 0, went up at all. It re-scans the PR's merge-base tree and its
head tree and compares per file (`dupes` needs every file scanned at each
point to find a match's other half, so there's no cheaper way to get an
accurate "before" count for one file). `Tidy-Exempt:` bypasses it the same
way it bypasses the message-pattern ratchet below — one exemption
mechanism, not two.

This only covers the 8 craftCov-detectable heuristics. Four more (CG032-
CG035) have their own separate mechanical gate — see "The complexity
ratchet" below. The remaining 23 keep the judgment-call procedure above,
backed only by the message-pattern ratchet below, not a count-based gate.

## The complexity ratchet — cyclomatic, cognitive, invariant return, duplicated literal

A second diff-aware gate, independent of craftCov and Refactor First above
(different tools, different catalog entries — CG032-CG035 — no `detectors`
field, since that key specifically means "craftcov.py's own scan covers
this," and these don't). `scripts/check_complexity_ratchet.py`:

- **High Cyclomatic Complexity** (McCabe) and **High Cognitive Complexity**
  (SonarQube S3776 — a different measure: it charges for *nesting*, so a
  function radon calls simple can still be over) — same threshold (15),
  same ratchet rule as below, reported separately since a refactor can fix
  one without the other.
- **Invariant Return** (S3516) — every `return` in a function hands back
  the same never-rebound name, reading as several outcomes when it's
  really one.
- **Duplicated String Literal** (S1192) — the same literal (5+ characters)
  repeated 3+ times in one file, scoped per file rather than per function.

**The ratchet rule**: a function/literal is a violation when its metric
exceeds the threshold *and* increased versus the base ref (a brand-new
function has base complexity 0) — blocking a new function over threshold,
an already-complex function made worse, and a simple function pushed over,
while allowing untouched complex functions and ones refactored *down*.
Grandfathered, not retroactive: this is about not making things worse from
here, the same spirit as Refactor First, not a demand to fix everything
that already exists.

```bash
uv sync --extra complexity                                    # radon + cognitive-complexity
uv run python3 scripts/check_complexity_ratchet.py --base origin/main
```

Wired into CI as the `complexity` job, PR-only, alongside `tidy` and
`refactor-first`. `Tidy-Exempt:` bypasses it the same way it bypasses the
other two — one exemption mechanism for all three gates.

## Reporting — visible, not just enforced

Two optional, non-blocking mechanisms make craftCov's findings visible
without gating anything: a sticky PR comment showing what changed in this
PR (`scripts/craftcov_pr_comment.py`), and a GitHub code-scanning SARIF
export showing the repo's current state overall
(`craftcov.py --format sarif`). Neither is a ratchet — nothing here fails
a build. See DESIGN.md's **Reporting** section for the full detail and
the CI wiring.

## Don't let the exemption become the rule

`Tidy-Exempt:` trusts the author's judgment, which erodes under deadline
pressure like any such gate. Check the ratio periodically, don't just trust
the gate exists:

```bash
git log --grep='^tidy(' --oneline | wc -l
git log --grep='^Tidy-Exempt:' --oneline | wc -l

# which sources actually get cited
git log --grep='^Tidy-Source:' -E --pretty=format:'%b' \
  | grep '^Tidy-Source:' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

If exemptions start dominating tidyings, that's a signal the discipline
slipped — the response is to look at *why*, not to remove the check.

The same caution applies to any other diff-aware skip heuristic a project
adds on top of this (e.g. a CI job that skips a slow test tier based on
changed paths): only widen what it trusts from evidence — an actual
import-graph check, a real dependency trace — never from a hunch, and keep
an unconditional full run on a schedule independent of what any single
change skipped. A heuristic that quietly gets more permissive over time is
the same failure mode as a rubber-stamped exemption, just automated.

## Query your history

```bash
# everything
git log --oneline --grep='^tidy(\|^test(characterize):'

# counts per type, per month
git log --pretty=format:'%ad %s' --date=format:'%Y-%m' --grep='^tidy(' \
  | sed -E 's/^([0-9-]+) tidy\(([a-z-]+)\).*/\1 \2/' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```
