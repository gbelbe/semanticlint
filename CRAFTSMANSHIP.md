# Craftsmanship catalog

This is the source of truth for everything except the two catalog tables
below, which are generated from `catalog.yaml` — edit that file, not the
tables here directly (see the repo's CONTRIBUTING.md, "Adding a heuristic
or rule").
This file does not assume any particular AI tool or editor — a human
contributor, a CI script, or an agent can all read it directly. Tool-specific
wrappers (an agent guidance file, a pre-commit hook, a CI job) point back
here rather than re-stating it.

Two separate concerns, on purpose:

1. **Writing new code well the first time** — a checklist, not a commit
   ritual. Nothing to "tidy" in code that doesn't exist yet.
2. **Changing existing code safely** — Kent Beck's *Tidy First?* discipline:
   every commit is either structural (doesn't change behavior) or behavioral
   (changes what the code does), never both. When existing code is untested
   ("legacy," per Feathers' definition below), tidying needs a safety net
   first.

Every entry below is attributed. When you act on one — proposing it to the
developer, or citing it in a commit — **name the smell and its source**, the
same way you'd cite a source in any other claim. "This function does two
unrelated things (Feature Envy, Fowler)" is a specific, checkable claim.
"This could be cleaner" is not.

## Procedure

### Before writing a feature or fix on existing code

1. Read the file(s)/function(s)/class(es) the change is about to touch.
2. Check them against the catalog below. For each smell that applies, work
   out what it's actually worth here: the smell you found, its source, the
   tidying/refactoring that addresses it, and the concrete value it brings to
   the change that follows.
3. **Ask the developer to confirm before touching anything — don't decide
   silently.** Which tidying (if any) is worth doing is a judgment call the
   automation can't make:
   - One candidate: state the smell (with its source), the fix, and the
     value it brings; ask for a go/no-go.
   - Several candidates: present them as options, each with its own value
     explanation and source; ask which to do — "none of these" is valid.
4. Once confirmed, make *only* that change, confirm existing tests are
   unchanged, and commit it alone (see **Commit convention** below).
5. Only then commit the feature/fix itself, as its own commit.
6. If nothing applies, or the developer declines every option, don't invent
   one — commit the feature with a `Tidy-Exempt:` trailer instead (see
   below).
7. Never mix a tidying commit with a behavior change in the same diff.

### Before writing new code

Run it past the **new-code checklist** below *before* declaring it done —
this is a design pass, not a commit type. Most of it (SOLID, the four rules
of simple design, Command-Query Separation) genuinely isn't mechanically
checkable the way a diff is; that part stays on the author and the
reviewer. A meaningful subset of it *is* mechanically checkable, though,
with exact numbers — see **The mechanical floor** below — and staying
inside those numbers while writing is what makes `refactor-first` and
`complexity` pass on the first push instead of a flag-then-fix cycle.
Before calling new code done, run both locally against it: `uv run
python3 scripts/craftcov.py --file <path>` and `uv run python3
scripts/check_complexity_ratchet.py --path <dir> --base origin/main`.

### Before refactoring code with no tests (legacy code)

See **Working with legacy code** below — write a characterization test
first, then tidy under its safety net.

## The catalog

### Structural tidyings — Kent Beck, *Tidy First?* (2023)

Small, purely structural moves: they don't change behavior, so a tidying
commit's test results must be identical before and after.

Broader than Tidy First's structural-only scope — these describe design
problems and their standard fixes. They apply to existing code you're about
to touch *and* are worth watching for while writing new code.

*Comments as a smell* (Fowler, and independently Martin below): a comment
explaining *what* a block does is a signal the block wants a name, not a
comment — that's `extract-helper`/`explaining-variable`, not
`explaining-comment`. Reach for `explaining-comment` only for *why*, never
*what*.

*Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces*: usually the same situation
as `normalize-symmetries` one level up — two things that do the same job
should look like it.

### New-code principles — Robert C. Martin, *Clean Code* (2008)

Design checklist, not a commit ritual — apply while writing, not after.

- **A function does one thing, and stays small.** If you're reaching for
  "and" to describe what it does, it's two functions.
- **Prefer 0–2 arguments; 3 is a smell, more needs restructuring.** Stricter
  than the mechanical gate below (which allows up to 5) on purpose — this is
  the *design* bar, the gate is the *floor* it won't let you fall under.
  Often `introduce-parameter-object` (above) is the fix, before the function
  is even written.
- **No flag arguments.** A boolean parameter that makes a function silently
  do one of two different things should be two functions.
- **Command-Query Separation.** A function either does something or answers
  something — never both. A function named `getX` that also mutates state
  will surprise every caller that doesn't read its body.
- **SOLID** (Martin, *Agile Software Development*, 2002) — most relevant day
  to day: **Dependency Inversion** (isolate an external library behind a
  thin internal adapter — the rest of the code depends on your interface,
  not the library) and **Single Responsibility** (one reason to change,
  which is exactly what `extract-class` fixes after the fact).

### The bar for new code — Kent Beck, *Extreme Programming Explained* (1999/2004)

Beck's four rules of simple design, **in priority order** — when they
conflict, an earlier rule wins:

1. Passes all the tests.
2. Reveals intention (a reader doesn't have to guess what it's for).
3. No duplication.
4. Fewest elements (no speculative generality — YAGNI, applied prospectively).

### A stricter optional reference — Sandi Metz's rules

Deliberately extreme, meant to provoke a conversation rather than be taken
literally: classes ≤100 lines, methods ≤5 lines, ≤4 parameters. Useful when
a project's own complexity ceiling feels too permissive and the team wants a
sharper target to aim for — not a gate.

### The mechanical floor — the exact numbers the gates check

Everything above is design judgment; these are the literal thresholds
`refactor-first` and `complexity` enforce. Stay under them while writing
and CI passes on the first push instead of a flag-then-fix round trip —
that's the entire point of knowing them in advance rather than only
reactively, after craftCov or the complexity ratchet report something.

| Heuristic | Exact threshold | Checked by |
|---|---|---|
| `introduce-parameter-object` | > 5 parameters | ruff `PLR0913` |
| `extract-helper` | > 50 statements in one function | ruff `PLR0915` |
| `replace-conditional-with-polymorphism` | > 12 branches (`if`/`elif`/`for`/`except`/`match` combined) | ruff `PLR0912` |
| `extract-class` | > 7 instance attributes, or > 20 public methods | pylint `R0902` / `R0904` |
| `explaining-constant` | any numeric literal outside `{-1, 0, 1}` used in a comparison | ruff `PLR2004` |
| `consolidate-duplicate-conditional` | ≥ 8 consecutive lines duplicated elsewhere (exact match, comments/imports/blanks excluded) | `dupes` (calibrated against PMD CPD — see DESIGN.md) |
| `guard-clauses`, `dead-code` | pattern-based, not a count — see the catalog table above | ruff `RET505` / `F401`/`F811`/`F841` + vulture |
| High cyclomatic / cognitive complexity (CG032/CG033) | > 15 (both measures, same threshold, reported separately) | `radon` / `cognitive-complexity` |
| Invariant return (CG034) | pattern-based: every `return` in a function hands back the same never-rebound name | AST check, own logic |
| Duplicated string literal (CG035) | same literal (5+ chars) repeated > 2 times in one file | AST check, own logic |

These are ruff/pylint's **own defaults** (unless a repo's own config
overrides them — check `[tool.ruff.lint.pylint]`/`.pylintrc` before
assuming) — craft-gate didn't invent them, and doesn't second-guess them,
the same "reuse a reference implementation" principle **craftCov** and
**The complexity ratchet** already apply to the tools they wrap.

**Before considering a change done**, not just before touching existing
code: `uv run python3 scripts/craftcov.py --file <path>` and
`uv run python3 scripts/check_complexity_ratchet.py --path <dir> --base
origin/main` both run cleanly against *new* code too, not only against
what Refactor First already tracked before you started. A clean local run
of both is the actual precondition for "CI will pass" — running them is
cheaper and faster than finding out from a failed push.

## Working with legacy code — Michael Feathers, *Working Effectively with Legacy Code* (2004)

Feathers' definition: **legacy code is code without tests** — age is
irrelevant. Untested code can't be tidied safely the normal way, because
"confirm the existing tests are unchanged" (the whole point of a structural
commit) has nothing to confirm against.

The procedure, step by step:

1. **Find a seam** — a place you can observe or change behavior without
   editing the code at that exact spot (a constructor argument, a factory,
   an injected dependency).
2. **Write a characterization test** — a test that documents what the code
   *actually does right now*, including its bugs. It isn't asserting the
   code is correct, only that you've pinned its current behavior down before
   touching it. Commit it on its own:
   ```
   test(characterize): pin OrderValidator.validate's current null-handling

   Tidy-Source: Michael Feathers, Working Effectively with Legacy Code (2004)
   ```
3. **Now tidy or refactor under that safety net**, same procedure as above —
   the characterization test is what "confirm existing tests are unchanged"
   means for code that had no tests at all a moment ago.
4. Once real (intent-driven, not just characterizing) tests exist, the code
   graduates out of "legacy" — the characterization test can be extended or
   replaced by tests that assert *intended* behavior rather than merely
   *current* behavior.

A `test(characterize):` commit satisfies the tidy-ratchet the same way a
`tidy(<type>):` commit does (see **The ratchet**) — it's the prerequisite
move for legacy code, not an exemption from the discipline.

---

## Commit convention

```
tidy(extract-class): split OrderValidator's audit-log concern into its own class

Tidy-Type: extract-class
Tidy-Source: Martin Fowler (with Kent Beck), Refactoring, 2nd ed. (2018)
Tidy-Scope: OrderValidator
```

- **Subject**: `tidy(<id>): <what and where>`, `<id>` from the catalog's
  `id` column.
- **`Tidy-Type:`** — same id, machine-queryable.
- **`Tidy-Source:`** — the author/book the smell or tidying comes from. If
  it's a locally-invented tidying not in this catalog, say so plainly
  (`Tidy-Source: project convention, see docs/...`) rather than omit it —
  the point is traceability, not gatekeeping which sources count.
- **`Tidy-Scope:`** — the function/class/module touched.

If nothing applied and none was invented:

```
Tidy-Exempt: <one-line reason>
```

Legacy-code prerequisite work uses `test(characterize):` (see above) instead
of `tidy(...)`.

## The ratchet

A commit-message check (`scripts/check_tidy_ratchet.sh`) fails a push/PR
whose commit range has no `tidy(<type>):` commit, no `test(characterize):`
commit, and no `Tidy-Exempt:` trailer. Text-only, no test run — costs
milliseconds. It cannot judge whether the right tidying was picked, only
that the discipline (or an explicit, reviewable exemption) was followed.

## Refactor First — a mechanically-enforced instance of the procedure above

For any heuristic craftCov can detect (see DESIGN.md's craftCov section, or
`scripts/craftcov.py --list-detectors` — 8 of the 35 entries above as of
this writing), the "which tidying, ask the developer" judgment call in step
3 of the procedure becomes fully mechanical instead:

1. Before touching file `F`, scope craftCov to it:
   `uv run python3 scripts/craftcov.py --file <F>`.
2. For each detectable heuristic present (count > 0), fix exactly **one**
   instance — the catalog's `action` field says what to do. A heuristic at
   0 for this file needs nothing.
3. Bundle every fix into **one** commit, not one per heuristic:

   ```
   tidy(multi): order_validator.py — one fix per present heuristic (4 -> 0)

   Tidy-Scope: order_validator.py
   Tidy-Fix: CG012 extract-helper (Kent Beck, Tidy First? 2023) 3->2
   Tidy-Fix: CG002 dead-code (Kent Beck, Tidy First? 2023) 5->4
   Tidy-Fix: CG009 explaining-constant (Kent Beck, Tidy First? 2023) 2->1
   ```

   `Tidy-Fix:` — repeated, one line per heuristic fixed — replaces the
   single `Tidy-Type:`/`Tidy-Source:` pair for this bundled case: a
   heuristic id, its source, and its before→after count in one line.
   `Tidy-Scope:` stays as in the general convention above.
4. Only then commit the feature/fix itself, as usual.

**Bounded effort, not exhaustive.** This fixes one instance of every present
heuristic type per touch, not the whole file — a heavily-smelly legacy file
doesn't need to be perfect before a feature can land in it, just measurably
better. Counts trend to zero over repeated touches, the same incremental
spirit as the rest of this catalog.

**Enforced, not just documented.** `scripts/check_refactor_first.py` (wired
into CI as the `refactor-first` job, PR-only) fails a PR when a touched
`.py` file's *total* across the 8 detectable heuristics didn't go down
relative to where the branch diverged from its base — or, if the file was
already at 0, went up at all. It re-scans the PR's merge-base tree and its
head tree and compares per file (`dupes` needs every file scanned at each
point to find a match's other half, so there's no cheaper way to get an
accurate "before" count for one file). `Tidy-Exempt:` bypasses it the same
way it bypasses the message-pattern ratchet below — one exemption
mechanism, not two.

This only covers the 8 craftCov-detectable heuristics. Four more (CG032-
CG035) have their own separate mechanical gate — see "The complexity
ratchet" below. The remaining 23 keep the judgment-call procedure above,
backed only by the message-pattern ratchet below, not a count-based gate.

## The complexity ratchet — cyclomatic, cognitive, invariant return, duplicated literal

A second diff-aware gate, independent of craftCov and Refactor First above
(different tools, different catalog entries — CG032-CG035 — no `detectors`
field, since that key specifically means "craftcov.py's own scan covers
this," and these don't). `scripts/check_complexity_ratchet.py`:

- **High Cyclomatic Complexity** (McCabe) and **High Cognitive Complexity**
  (SonarQube S3776 — a different measure: it charges for *nesting*, so a
  function radon calls simple can still be over) — same threshold (15),
  same ratchet rule as below, reported separately since a refactor can fix
  one without the other.
- **Invariant Return** (S3516) — every `return` in a function hands back
  the same never-rebound name, reading as several outcomes when it's
  really one.
- **Duplicated String Literal** (S1192) — the same literal (5+ characters)
  repeated 3+ times in one file, scoped per file rather than per function.

**The ratchet rule**: a brand-new function over threshold is always a
violation (base complexity 0). An *existing* function/literal already over
threshold that this change's diff actually reaches (matched by line range
against `git diff`) must come out **lower** than it went in — left
unchanged is not enough, only a genuine decrease passes. One the diff
never reaches at all is grandfathered regardless of its number. This is
stricter than "never worse": touching a bad function obligates you to
improve it, at least a little — it doesn't have to reach the threshold in
one PR, just move the right direction. Not retroactive, though: nothing
here forces anyone to go looking for complexity to fix in code nobody's
touching.

```bash
uv sync --extra complexity                                    # radon + cognitive-complexity
uv run python3 scripts/check_complexity_ratchet.py --base origin/main
```

Wired into CI as the `complexity` job, PR-only, alongside `tidy` and
`refactor-first`. `Tidy-Exempt:` bypasses it the same way it bypasses the
other two — one exemption mechanism for all three gates.

## Patch coverage — new code must be tested, not just committed

A fourth gate, orthogonal to everything above: none of the other three
check whether a change has *tests* at all, only whether its structure is
sound. [`diff-cover`](https://github.com/Bachmann1234/diff_cover)
(third-party, not a craft-gate script) reads a coverage report and a git
diff together, and fails when the lines the diff actually *changed* are
under-covered — untouched parts of the repo don't count, so this isn't a
whole-repo coverage floor (which a well-tested old codebase can clear while
a brand-new untested file quietly drags the average down only slightly).

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=<your_package> --cov-report=xml
uv run diff-cover coverage.xml --compare-branch origin/main --fail-under 90
```

Wired into CI as the `patch-coverage` job, PR-only. **No `Tidy-Exempt:`
bypass** — deliberately, unlike the three gates above: this ports the exact
mechanism an existing, well-tested project (kai-ster) already runs
unconditionally, and diff-cover itself has no concept of a commit-trailer
exemption to hook into. If a real exception is needed (a generated file,
a vendored import), exclude it from coverage measurement itself
(`--cov=<your_package>` / a `[tool.coverage.run] omit` entry), not from
this gate.

**90% is kai-ster's own number, not a mandated one** — CRAFTSMANSHIP.md
ships the pattern; the threshold is yours to set per repo.

## Mutation ratchet — coverage measures execution, not assertion

Patch coverage answers "did a test run this line?" A test with no
assertion, or one asserting the wrong thing, still counts as covering the
line — coverage can't tell tested from merely-executed apart. Mutation
testing can: [`mutmut`](https://github.com/boxed/mutmut) changes one small
thing about your code (a `>` to a `>=`, a `+` to a `-`) and reruns your
tests — if they all still pass, that mutant *survived*, meaning nothing
actually checks the behavior that changed. `scripts/check_mutation_ratchet.py`
fails when a function **this change's diff touches** has a mutation score
(killed / (killed + survived), mutmut's own metric) below `--threshold`.

```bash
uv sync --extra mutation                                      # mutmut
uv run mutmut run                                              # generates + runs mutants
uv run python3 scripts/check_mutation_ratchet.py --base origin/main --threshold 80
```

**One of the five default gates (`templates/ci-job.yml`), but a verified
no-op until you opt in.** Mutation testing reruns your whole test suite
once per mutant — a different cost order than everything above — so the
CI job's first step checks for a `[tool.mutmut]` (or `setup.cfg`'s
`[mutmut]`) section and skips every remaining step when it's absent.
Confirmed against a real mutmut run, not assumed: with no config, `mutmut
run` either guesses a source directory from a common layout and mutates it
without asking, or crashes outright — neither is acceptable to run
unannounced on every repo that adopts craft-gate, hence the explicit
config check rather than trusting mutmut's own guessing. Add
`[tool.mutmut]` with your `source_paths` to activate it for real. See
DESIGN.md's "Mutation ratchet" for the full rationale, including why this
checks a flat floor on the current tree rather than a base-vs-head
comparison like the complexity ratchet.

**A genuinely equivalent mutant** (code where no test *could* tell the
difference because the behavior really is identical) gets mutmut's own
`# pragma: no mutate` — the same idea as coverage.py's `# pragma: no
cover`. This fixes the false positive at its source; don't reach for
`Tidy-Exempt:` for a single surviving mutant, save it for skipping the
gate entirely on a PR where that's the right call.

## Reporting — visible, not just enforced

Two default, non-blocking mechanisms make craftCov's findings visible
without gating anything: a sticky PR comment showing what changed in this
PR (`scripts/craftcov_pr_comment.py`), and a GitHub code-scanning SARIF
export showing the repo's current state overall
(`craftcov.py --format sarif`). Neither is a ratchet — nothing here fails
a build. See DESIGN.md's **Reporting** section for the full detail and
the CI wiring.

## Don't let the exemption become the rule

`Tidy-Exempt:` trusts the author's judgment, which erodes under deadline
pressure like any such gate. Check the ratio periodically, don't just trust
the gate exists:

```bash
git log --grep='^tidy(' --oneline | wc -l
git log --grep='^Tidy-Exempt:' --oneline | wc -l

# which sources actually get cited
git log --grep='^Tidy-Source:' -E --pretty=format:'%b' \
  | grep '^Tidy-Source:' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

If exemptions start dominating tidyings, that's a signal the discipline
slipped — the response is to look at *why*, not to remove the check.

The same caution applies to any other diff-aware skip heuristic a project
adds on top of this (e.g. a CI job that skips a slow test tier based on
changed paths): only widen what it trusts from evidence — an actual
import-graph check, a real dependency trace — never from a hunch, and keep
an unconditional full run on a schedule independent of what any single
change skipped. A heuristic that quietly gets more permissive over time is
the same failure mode as a rubber-stamped exemption, just automated.

## Query your history

```bash
# everything
git log --oneline --grep='^tidy(\|^test(characterize):'

# counts per type, per month
git log --pretty=format:'%ad %s' --date=format:'%Y-%m' --grep='^tidy(' \
  | sed -E 's/^([0-9-]+) tidy\(([a-z-]+)\).*/\1 \2/' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```
